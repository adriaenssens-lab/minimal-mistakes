## PhD student projects
PhD students in our group are funded through the Norwich Research Park Doctoral Training Programme [NRPDTP](https://biodtp.norwichresearchpark.ac.uk/) or the Microbes, Microbiomes and Bioinformatics DTP [MMBDTP](https://www.uea.ac.uk/web/research/research-with-us/postgraduate-research/latest-phds-and-research-studentships/partnerships-in-doctoral-training/mmb). When funded projects are approved for advertisement, they will appear on the respective web pages and will be listed here. Projects for a 2023 start have been filled. 


## Prospective project students
We regularly host project students from the University of East Anglia for Honours and Masters research projects.
