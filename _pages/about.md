We are a research group of microbiologists, biotechnologists and computational biologists with an interest in bacteriophages and other viruses. We are curious about the role and function of viruses in the microbiome and passionate about using bacteriophages to improve health, whether it's our own, that of animals, the food chain or the environment.  
  
We are located at the [Quadram Institute Bioscience](www.quadram.ac.uk) on the Norwich Research Park in the East of England.    

## Evelien Adriaenssens
I'm Evelien Adriaenssens, Group Leader and Principal Investigator.  

I'm originally from Belgium, where is studied for a Master's and PhD in Bioscience Engineering at the KU Leuven. During my PhD, I worked on the development of new bacteriophages as biocontrol agents against potato rot. In 2013, I moved to South Africa for a postdoctoral fellowship on the microbial ecology of viruses in desert soils. I moved to Liverpool in 2016 to investigate the use of viromics to track pathogenic viruses in the environment. I started my research group in 2019, exploring viruses in the human gut microbiome and their applications.
